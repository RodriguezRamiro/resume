## 💻 About Me

I’m a motivated **Junior Full-Stack Developer** with hands-on experience building modern, responsive web applications using **Python, JavaScript, React, and Flask**.

I recently completed Software Engineering training at the **University of South Florida**, where I built full-stack applications and collaborated using Git, GitHub, APIs, and agile workflows. I enjoy solving problems, designing clean UIs, and building applications that are functional, responsive, and user-focused.

I am currently seeking a **Junior Developer**, **Frontend Developer**, or **Entry-Level Software Engineer** role where I can grow and contribute to real-world projects.
